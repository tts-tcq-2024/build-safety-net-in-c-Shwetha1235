Test Name,Input,Expected Output,Description
HandlesEmptyInput,""""" (Empty string)","""""",Ensures that empty input results in an empty Soundex code.
HandlesSingleConsonant,"""B""","""B000""",Verifies that a single consonant is followed by three zeros.
HandlesOnlyVowels,"""AEIOU""","""A000""","Ensures that vowels are ignored after the first letter, resulting in A000."
IgnoresCaseDifferences (Case 1),"""Smith""","""S530""",Verifies that mixed-case names are correctly handled.
IgnoresCaseDifferences (Case 2),"""sMiTh""","""S530""",Verifies that names with different cases result in the same Soundex code.
HandlesRepeatedConsonants (Case 1),"""Bbbb""","""B100""",Checks that repeated consonants are compressed into one.
HandlesRepeatedConsonants (Case 2),"""Ddddd""","""D300""","Another case of repeated consonants, verifying compression."
HandlesSpecialCharacters,"""D#o&g""","""D020""",Ensures special characters are ignored in the name while generating Soundex.
TruncatesLongNames (Case 1),"""Washington""","""W252""",Ensures that names longer than 4 characters are truncated correctly.
TruncatesLongNames (Case 2),"""Gutierrez""","""G362""",Another case of truncating long names.
HandlesNameWithMultipleZeroMappedLetters,"""Ashcraft""","""A261""",Verifies handling of names where some characters map to zero and others don't.
PadsShortNamesWithZeros (Case 1),"""Li""","""L000""",Ensures that short names are padded with zeros to make the Soundex code 4 chars.
PadsShortNamesWithZeros (Case 2),"""Ga""","""G000""",Another case of padding short names with zeros.
HandlesEdgeCasesWithMixedZeroMappingAndDuplicates,"""Honeyman""","""H555""","Verifies handling of names with 'H' and 'Y', which map to 0, and duplicate letters."
